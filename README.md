# [TTT] M9K Weapons (Fixed)
This addon aims to reproduce the purpose of the [TTT M9K Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=716631815) addon by [BocciardoLight](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bocciardolight), but with a few things fixed:
* Fixes many of the weapons not working in newer versions of GMod/TTT
* Fixes weapons showing as errors if a dependant pack is not installed
  * Instead, these weapons are simply prevented from registering
* Fixed compatibility with the [Support C_hands for M9K](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3451239016) addon by [Риджи](https://steamcommunity.com/id/435325228)

This is mostly just renaming and moving some files to get TTT to recognize them properly.
